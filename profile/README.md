### Overview
An AI-powered fintech platform designed to help Brazilian middle-class investors safely enter the stock market through intelligent, ai-driven portfolio management. Our solution addresses the common barriers that prevent everyday Brazilians from investing: lack of time to study economics, fear of investment scams, and inadequate returns from traditional investment methods like INSS, Renda Fixa, and Poupança.

The platform features a series of custom AI models, called MUSA (Mansa's Unsupervised Stocks Analyst) trained on robust datasets and algorithms related to the Brazilian Stock Market and economics. Our system analyzes market patterns and trends, builds and manages the portfolio through a score system and in-depth analysis through our MUSA models, provide analysis of the market to its investors, like the Aladdin system by BlackRock, Inc.
